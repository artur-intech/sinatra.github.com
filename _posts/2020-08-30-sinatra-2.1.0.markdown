Today we would like to inform you that we have released Sinatra v2.1.0. It's a big milestore for us and contains some bug fixes and supported runtime changes.

## Key Updates

### Ruby 2.2. support was dropped

Ruby 2.2 support is dropped from this version. We will no longer check the operation on Ruby 2.2.
Please upgrade your ruby version if you're still using Ruby 2.2.

### Thin support dropped

From this verseion, we dropped the support for thin. This does not mean that the stream block will be immediately broken by thin.

For example, in the case where the sinatra `run!` method is called for self-hosting the sinatra application, it may not work properly due to the following causes.

- [The standard thin handler was removed from Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/98d9cf5834d4e27e34bbaa017cdfc68795763b55)
- [Thin removed from sinatra's default servers](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/commit/607346295924c75a86f12ecbad9430cfc430c032#diff-f2bc16b264ca20ca842cf15d82960d34L1852)

If you still want to use thin in the above scenario, you should load [the newly added rack handler for thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin/commit/b201525f0db7d7e9faf26681b68646e0be9f96ec) and specify your server like the following:

```ruby
set :server, :thin
```

#### Rainbows support on the stream feature

Our stream feature has been tested by thin for many years. From this version, it is replaced with rainbows.
This does not mean that the stream block will be immediately broken by thin.

However, we recommend migrating to rainbows if you want to use the stream feature.
Please have a look at [our README](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra#streaming-responses) to know how to integrate with Rainbows.
